# Laser-Cut Nukit Open Upper-Room UVGI

Laser-Cut Nukit Open Upper-Room UVGI fixtures are designed to be made on laser diode or CO2 laser cutters, anywhere in the world, from local materials. They cost a fraction of the price of commercial UR-UVGI fixtures and can be customized to suit local conditions. They do, however, require careful installation by trained technicians. Once that's done, they are extremely effective, safe, and inexpensive to operate.

**Pendent Style- Wood**

This is a very powerful, very low-cost mitigation tool that, with appropriate training, can be rapidly deployed in disaster areas, field hospitals, refugee camps, commandeered auditoriums and gymnasiums. Any place that is large, crowded, has high ceilings and is high risk for aerosol transmission. 

When cut out of 2mm plywood the cost is about 8USD. Combined with an Ikea [STRÅLA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/strala-cord-set-white-90371505/) (5USD) or [HEMMA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/hemma-cord-set-white-50386580/) (10USD) and a UVC CFL bulb there is very little light leakage below the fixture. The irradiation field is 360° and 3° down (see diagram). As such, very little light is wasted, and they are extremely efficient.

At and above ahorizontal plane the output level is approximately:  
16μW/cm2 @ 1m  
7μW/cm2 @ 1.5m  
4μW/cm2 @ 2m

[This version is the best one to start with](https://github.com/opennukit/Nukit-Open-Upper-Room-UVGI/tree/main/LaserCut/Nukit%20Open%20Upper%20Room%20UVGI%20Pendent%20Fixture/Nukit%20Open%20Upper%20Room%20UVGI%20Pendent%20Fixture%202mm%20Flat%20Pack%20V2), as it is nested and shippable. Secures with zip-ties, forming an extremely robust solid block that stacks and stands up well to rough handling. The assembly instructions are [here](https://github.com/opennukit/Nukit-Open-Upper-Room-UVGI/blob/main/LaserCut/Nukit%20Open%20Upper%20Room%20UVGI%20Pendent%20Fixture/Nukit%20Open%20Upper%20Room%20UVGI%20Pendent%20Fixture-Assembly.pdf)

Note- coiled E27 UVC CFL bulbs have become difficult to find, but this fixture design can accommodate the more easy-to-source [long and straight E27 UVC CFL bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/coospider-repta-Sanitizer-Germicidal-Replacement-Disinfection/dp/B0CG39F65Z/) simply by adding additional layers of louvers. (NOTE: DO NOT USE UVC LAMPS UNLESS YOU ARE A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL WITH A UVC METER- USE WHITE LIGHTS FOR TESTING)

**Wall-Mount Style- Wood**
---
This style has a more tightly controlled output than the above pendent-style lamp, making it much less powerful but also far easier and safer to install. Using aluminum tape inside the box will greatly improve its efficiency. It uses two [6W T5 mercury vapor UVC lamps](https://www.amazon.com/UV-Sanitizer-253-7nm-wavelength-Bathroom/dp/B0B5CV9PB5). The fixture can easily be extended to accommodate any length of T5 fixture up to 150cm. (NOTE: DO NOT USE UVC LAMPS UNLESS YOU ARE A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL WITH A UVC METER- USE WHITE LIGHTS FOR TESTING)

**Wall-Mount Style- Metal**
---
An all-metal version of the Nukit Open Upper Room UVGI Wall-Mount fixture. It is designed for local manufacturing and commercial deployment in any country. It can be made in most sheet metal shops equipped with laser or waterjet cutters for a fraction of the cost of importing UR-UVGI devices from overseas.
